I first saw him in the movie &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and was immediately drawn to his incredible talent and charisma. In the movie &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, Clint Eastwood played the character of William Munny, a retired outlaw who is forced to pick up his guns one last time to help a young prostitute seek revenge against the men who disfigured her. Eastwood's portrayal of Munny brought a depth and complexity to the character that was truly mesmerizing to watch. From his quiet determination to his intense emotional scenes, Eastwood's performance was nothing short of brilliant. And this is the mainly reason why I admire this actor, his ability to fully embody and bring to life his characters is simply awe-inspiring. <u>He has a way of making you believe in the reality of the world he's portraying, and his performances are always powerful and captivating</u>. Besides, his contributions to the film industry as a whole also cannot be overstated. Not only has he starred in countless iconic movies, but he has also directed and produced many award-winning films. His versatility and dedication make him a true icon and effect me deeply.</p> <p>1 Why do children love dressing up in costumes?</p> <p>​	Children love dressing up in costumes because it allows them to use their imagination and creativity to become someone else. It also gives them the opportunity to explore different roles and personalities, and to engage in pretend play which can be very enjoyable for them.</p> <p>2 Do you think it benefits children when they play a role in drama?</p> <p>​	Yes, I think it benefits children when they play a role in drama. It can help to develop their social and emotional skills, as well as their confidence and self-esteem. Through drama, children can learn to express themselves in different ways and to communicate effectively with others. It can also be a fun and engaging way for them to learn and explore new ideas.</p> <p>3 What are the differences between acting in a movie and in the theatre?</p> <p>​	Acting in a movie and in the theatre have some key differences. In movies, the acting is often more subtle and naturalistic, as the camera can capture even the smallest facial expressions and gestures. In contrast, in theatre, the acting is often more exaggerated and larger than life, as the actors need to project their voices and movements to the audience. Additionally, movie acting is typically filmed out of sequence, whereas theatre acting is done in real time from start to finish.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
