I got it from my wife about a year ago as a birthday gift. I use it almost daily for a variety of tasks such as writing code, doing research, and browsing the internet.</p> <p>​	However, I have to admit that I initially found it quite difficult to use because I was used to using Windows computers before. The operating system on the MacBook, called macOS, is quite different from Windows. For example, the file system is organized differently, and some keyboard shortcuts are not the same as well. So it took me some time to adapt to it.</p> <p>​	At first, I felt frustrated and even a bit intimidated by the MacBook, but after few days I gradually started to appreciate its features and design. I found that the interface is more intuitive and user-friendly once you get used to it. Also, the build quality of the MacBook is exceptional, and it feels very solid and well-made compared to other laptops I've used before.</p> <p>​	<u>Nowadays, I feel much more comfortable using my MacBook, and I even prefer it over Windows computers in some ways. For instance, I like the integration with other Apple devices such as my iPhone, and the ecosystem of apps and services is very convenient.</u> Overall, I think the MacBook is a great piece of technology, although it does take some time and effort to learn how to use it properly, especially if you're used to using Windows.</p> <ol><li>What technology do people currently use?</li></ol> <p>People currently use a wide variety of technology, ranging from smartphones and laptops to smart home devices and wearable tech. Some of the most popular technologies include social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram, messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat, and streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. Additionally, people use technology for work, education, entertainment, and communication, among other purposes.</p> <ol start="2"><li>Why do big companies introduce new products frequently?</li></ol> <p>Big companies introduce new products frequently for several reasons. One reason is to stay competitive in the market and attract new customers. Technology is constantly evolving, and companies that don't innovate risk falling behind their competitors. Another reason is to improve the user experience and address any issues or limitations with previous products. Finally, introducing new products can also generate hype and excitement, which could be beneficial to the share price and lead to increased sales and revenue for the company.</p> <ol start="3"><li>Why are people so keen on buying iPhones even though they haven’t changed much?</li></ol> <p>There are several reasons why people are keen on buying iPhones not matter if they need it or not. One reason is brand loyalty; many people have been using iPhones for years and are accustomed to the interface and features. Additionally, Apple has built a reputation for quality and design, and many people are willing to pay a premium for an iPhone simply because it's an Apple product. Finally, while the changes between iPhone models may not be drastic, they do usually offer some improvements and new features, such as better cameras, faster processors, or longer battery life.</p> <ol start="4"><li>Does the development of technology affect the way we study?</li></ol> <p>Yes, the development of technology has had a significant impact on the way we study. For example, we now are facing vast amounts of information and resources online everyday, teachnology can be a helper to filter the information that we actually needed. And technology has enabled lot of new forms of learning such as online courses, virtual reality simulations, and gamification. However, there are also concerns that technology can be a distraction and affect our ability to focus and retain information. As with any tool, it's important to use technology in a responsible and effective way to support our learning and academic goals.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
