There are tons of great educational resources available online, from video tutorials to interactive coding challenges, that I could use to build up my skills. And of course, the best way to handle programming is to actually write code, so I would want to set aside plenty of time for practice projects and experimenting with different techniques.</p> <p>​	The mainly reason why I would like to learn programming is because I believe it's a really valuable skill to have in today's job market, especially as more and more businesses moved online. Plus,  I've always been fascinated by the way that websites and apps work, so I would love to be able to create my own projects and bring my ideas to life.</p> <p>​	However, learning programing is not easy, <u>and I believe there's definitely a learning curve,</u> especially when you're starting from scratch like I am. But I am ready to face the challenge, and I believe that with dedication and persistence, I'll be able to make progress and eventually become proficient in programming. <u>It may take some time and effort, but I believe it will be worth it in the end.</u></p> <p>1 What’s the most popular skill to learn these days?</p> <p>​	In my opinion, the most popular skill to learn these days is probably digital marketing. With so many businesses operating online, there is a huge demand for professionals who can help them improve their online presence and reach new customers through social media, search engine optimization, and other digital marketing strategies. This is a skill that can be applied in a wide range of industries, from e-commerce to hospitality, and I think it's only going to become more important in the future.</p> <p>2 What makes young people choose a major, interest or future income?</p> <p>​	It's difficult to generalize about what motivates young people to choose a major, as everyone has their own unique set of priorities and interests. However, in my experience, many students are motivated by a combination of factors, including their passions and interests, the perceived value of different fields, and the potential for future income and career growth. Some students may be drawn to majors that align with their personal interests or talents, while others may prioritize fields that are in high demand or offer strong job prospects after graduation. Ultimately, I think it's important for students to find a balance between pursuing their passions and setting themselves up for future success in their chosen career paths.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
