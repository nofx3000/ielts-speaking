And I would likely stay there with my wife, who shares my love of art, culture, and history. I think that exploring the city together would be a wonderful way to create memories that we will cherish for years to come.</p> <p>​	While in Paris, there is so much to see and do, that it is difficult to decide where to start. However, I think that visiting some of the city's iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum would be a good place to begin. I would also love to stroll through some of the city's beautiful neighborhoods, such as the Marais, Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and Montmartre, and explore the local shops, restaurants, and cafes. <u>Paris is known for its excellent cuisine, so trying some of the local delicacies would be high on my list.</u></p> <p>​	I believe a short stay would be the perfect way to experience the city and have a taste of what it has to offer, because  I would be able to explore the best of Paris and soak up the atmosphere without feeling rushed or stressed. In conclusion, Paris is a city that has been on my travel wish list for a long time, and I would love to visit it someday.</p> <p><strong>1 Why do people sometimes go to other cities?</strong></p> <p>​	People generally enjoying seeing new things and visiting new places. That’s one reason why people might visit other cities – basically for tourism. Other reasons include visiting friends and family, or combining the two – tourism and family visits. Usually cities are where the most famous historical sites are, and the galleries and museums and places of interest, so very often if someone plans a holiday it will include a visit to the major city of the region. For example, there are some fantastic sites around Chengdu in the countryside, but on such a visit, people would usually choose to spend at least a day or two in the capital city itself, to get a real taste of the culture, the food, and the museums and places of interest in the city.</p> <p><strong>2 Why are historical cities popular?</strong></p> <p>​	People like history, and generally speaking historical cities are more aesthetically pleasing – at least the historical areas of major cities. Take Xi’an for example – the main area in the centre around the bell tower, and the wall and the muslim quarter, are the most beautiful areas of the city where you get to experience the flavor of ancient China. And this has also created a tourist industry where there are restaurants, souvenir markets and all sorts of other things that make a visit interesting and stimulating. So, historical cities are by far the most popular for tourism, for sure.</p> <p><strong>3 Do you think tourists may come across bad things in other cities?</strong></p> <p>​	Of course, sometimes. I don’t think it’s common that people have bad experiences in cities in my country – except the usual hassle of transport and crowds. But some cities can be dangerous if you’re in the wrong areas, maybe. There are rougher areas in every city in the world, and it’s best to know where these areas are and avoid them. However, generally, the main tourist areas of cities are well policed and protected, and the most hassle you are likely to get is arguing with sellers when you want to buy souvenirs! They can be quite intense and you have to haggle hard sometimes to get a good price – and you can get ripped off if you’re not careful. I guess that could be regarded as a ‘bad thing’ maybe.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
