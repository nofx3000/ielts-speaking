Andy is a programmer for as long as I can remember. He’s from my home town, but also, he went to the same university as me, in fact, in the same year. From my perspective , Andy has always been keen on starting his own business – he has a very strong entrepreneurial streak, and most certainly a good way of thinking about business and future trends. He seems always on the ball, always aware of key market trends across different industries and has a strong interest in innovation. So, as well as being a programmer, he’s actually a person who I am sure would make a fantastic business person, especially in the developing field of IT. As for me, I would love to start a small company too, because I’ve always wanted to work for myself, rather than be just a cog in the machine of a big established company. So Andy seems like an ideal person to start a new business with, because we’ve known each other for at least 10 years we are also very familiar with how best to communicate with each other, resolve conflicts that might arise and basically work hard to make a project or enterprise a real success. I’d love to work with Andy.</p> <p>studied international business management in university and I, too, feel I have an entrepreneurial tendency, so I would love to get together with Andy and create a small company. <u>I’ve always wanted to work for myself, rather than be just a cog in the machine of a big established company. And if you want to start and grow your own company you’ve really got to find a partner to work with, to share the burden and also to pool your skills and resources. And Andy, quite honestly, would be the ideal person in my opinion.</u> Because we’ve known each other for at least 10 years we are also very familiar with how best to communicate with each other, resolve conflicts that might arise and basically work hard to make a project or enterprise a real success. I’d love to work with Andy.</p> <p>1 How can we get good colleagues?</p> <p>​	One important factor is communication. Good communication involves being clear and concise in your communication, listening actively to others, and being open to feedback and constructive criticism. By communicating effectively, you can establish trust and build positive working relationships with your colleagues.</p> <p>​	Another important factor is showing respect and kindness towards your colleagues. This involves treating others with dignity and courtesy, avoiding gossip or negativity, and showing appreciation for their contributions to the team. By treating your colleagues with respect and kindness, you can create a positive and supportive work environment that encourages collaboration and productivity.</p> <p>2 Are good colleagues necessary at work?</p> <p>Yes, having good colleagues is essential in the workplace. Good colleagues can create a positive work environment. When people get along with their colleagues, they are more likely to enjoy coming to work each day, and the workplace becomes a more pleasant and welcoming place. This positivity can lead to increased motivation and higher job satisfaction, which can translate into improved productivity.</p> <p>3 What kinds of people are popular at work?</p> <p>​	In my opinion, people who are popular at work are those who possess a range of skills and qualities that enable them to excel in their role and collaborate effectively with others. One key trait that makes someone popular is their ability to communicate clearly and listen actively. These individuals are able to articulate their ideas and opinions effectively, while also demonstrating an openness to feedback and ideas from others. They are able to build strong relationships with colleagues and clients alike, which helps to facilitate collaboration and teamwork.</p> <p>4 Why should children be kind to their classmates?</p> <p>​	Kindness is a fundamental component of healthy social and emotional development. By treating their classmates with kindness and empathy, children learn to understand and appreciate diversity, to communicate effectively, and to resolve conflicts constructively. These are crucial life skills that will serve them well in both their personal and professional lives.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
