I was living in a shared house, and she was my neighbour. She is a fairly old, but very energetic lady, always changing her hair style and wore long flowing dresses, she was quite moody, but very lovely nevertheless. She had a small front garden and a quite long back garden. In the front garden she had wonderful flower beds of brightly coloured flowers, and a small lawn with a stone bird bath on it. And in the back garden she had bushes and a vegetable patch and some more leafy plants, like spider plant, peace lily and rubber plant and many i don't even know their name as well. Anyway, she spent quite a bit of time in her garden carefully looking after her plants, like tilling the soil around the vegetables, watering them during the dry summer and pruning the rose bushes.</p> <p>​	We chatted a lot that summer and became good friends. She told me she wasn’t so into people, or doing social things, but she did enjoy her plants. And a thing I learned from her is to appreciate nature and the simpler things in life. I believe that is the key to keep her positive and happy.</p> <p><strong>1 What do you think of the job, being a farmer?</strong></p> <p>​	In my opinion, being a farmer is an incredibly important and rewarding job. Farmers play a vital role in society by producing the food that we all rely on to survive. Not only do they provide us with essential nourishment, but they also help to sustain the environment by managing natural resources and promoting sustainable practices.</p> <p>​	Furthermore, being a farmer requires a wide range of skills and knowledge, from understanding crop cycles and soil conditions to managing livestock and machinery. This makes it a challenging and dynamic profession that requires dedication, hard work, and a passion for the land and its resources.</p> <p>​	Overall, I believe that being a farmer is a noble and admirable profession that deserves our respect and appreciation. Without farmers, we wouldn't have access to the food and resources that we need to thrive, and our world would be a much less sustainable and vibrant place.</p> <p><strong>2 Are there many people growing their own vegetables now?</strong></p> <p>​	Yes, there has been a notable increase in the number of people who are growing their own vegetables in recent years. This trend has been fueled by several factors, including a growing interest in sustainable living and a desire to eat healthier, fresher produce. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many individuals to turn to gardening as a way to cope with social distancing measures and food shortages.</p> <p>​	In particular, urban gardening has become increasingly popular, with more and more people cultivating vegetables in small spaces such as balconies, rooftops, and community gardens. This trend is especially evident among younger generations who are more environmentally conscious and tech-savvy, utilizing online resources and social media platforms to learn about gardening and share their experiences.</p> <p>​	Overall, the trend towards growing one's own vegetables is likely to continue as people become more aware of the benefits of sustainable living and prioritize healthy and locally-sourced food options.</p> <p><strong>3 Do you think it is good to let kids know how to plant?</strong></p> <p>​	I believe it is extremely beneficial to teach kids how to plant. Not only does it provide them with a valuable skill, but it also teaches them important values such as responsibility, patience, and respect for nature.</p> <p>​	Moreover, learning how to plant can also be a fun and rewarding experience for children. It allows them to connect with nature in a hands-on way, and it can be a great way to foster creativity and imagination. Furthermore, planting can be a great way to teach children about healthy eating habits and the importance of fresh produce.</p> <p><strong>4 What are the differences between traditional and modern agriculture?</strong></p> <p>​	There is a lot of differences between traditional and modern agriculture. One of the key differences is the use of technology. In traditional agriculture, farmers typically rely on manual labor and basic tools like hoes and plows. In contrast, modern agriculture involves the use of advanced machinery such as tractors, harvesters, and irrigation systems. Additionally, modern agriculture often relies on scientific research and technology to optimize crop growth, using techniques like genetically modified crops, precision agriculture, and hydroponics.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
