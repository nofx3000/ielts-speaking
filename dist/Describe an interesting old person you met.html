It was a very tastefully wedding, in a lovely hotel, with a very beautiful garden – just outside the city. The party began after the wedding ceremony and went on for many hours – with loads of great food and champagne . I drunk a lot and talked to loads of people, but the one that really impressed me was this old lady perhaps in her early 60s. She was in an elegent purple dress and stylish makeup. She was an interior designer for hotels and galleries all over Asia. She complimented my suit, and we got talking, and ended up chatting for hours. We talked about art, design, music and thoughts about life and all sorts of stuff. She invited me to the opening of one of her art galleries in Beijing, for the following week, and we ended up getting to know each other, and we still stay in touch today. I help her with promotions for some of her private exhibitions and translations for art gallery brochures and so on.What impressed me the most about this old lady was her passion for life. The attitude that always be positive and optimistic. She make me realize that age is not the factor that stop you from being young, it is the heart . If you keep a positive and optimistic attitude in your heart, you can be forever young.</p> <p><strong>1 Do you think old people and young people can have common interests?</strong></p> <p>​	Yes, I believe that old people and young people can have common interests. While there may be some differences in the types of activities or hobbies that each age group may enjoy, there are many interests that can transcend age. For example, both old and young people may enjoy reading, listening to music, watching movies, or playing sports. Additionally, there may be shared interests based on a common culture or historical event.</p> <p>​	Furthermore, I think it is important to recognize that age is not the only factor that determines a person's interests. People are complex and multifaceted, and their interests can be influenced by a variety of factors such as personality, upbringing, and life experiences. Therefore, it is possible for people of different ages to have similar interests if they share these other factors in common.</p> <p>​	Overall, I believe that age should not be a barrier to finding common interests between people. It is important to keep an open mind and to look for shared experiences and activities that can bring people together, regardless of their age.</p> <p><strong>2 What can old people teach young people?</strong></p> <p>​	Older people can teach younger people valuable life lessons that can help them navigate the challenges of the modern world. For example, they can share their wisdom and knowledge about important topics such as relationships, careers, and personal growth. Additionally, older people can teach younger people about resilience, patience, and perseverance - qualities that are essential for success in any area of life.</p> <p>​	Furthermore, older people can offer a unique perspective on history, culture, and societal changes, which can help younger people gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. In short, the knowledge and experience that older people possess can be incredibly valuable to younger generations, and it is important that we continue to recognize and appreciate their contributions to society.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
