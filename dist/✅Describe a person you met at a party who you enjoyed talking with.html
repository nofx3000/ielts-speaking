It was a really huge wedding – and both families were quite wealthy and popular, so they held a really fancy wedding. It wasn’t pretentious or showy, actually, it was just huge. It was very tastefully done, in a lovely hotel, with a very beautiful garden – just outside the city. Anyway, after the wedding ceremony, the party began and went on for many many hours – with loads of great food and champagne and all sorts. I was especially animated on this occasion, and felt very social, and talked to loads of people. But the one that really impressed me was an old lady, perhaps in her early 60s, in an elegent purple dress and stylish makeup. She was an interior designer for hotels and galleries all over Asia. We talked about art, design, music and thoughts about life and all sorts of stuff. She invited me to the opening of one of her art galleries in Beijing, for the following week, and we ended up getting to know each other, and we still stay in touch today. <u>I help her with promotions for some of her private exhibitions and translations for art gallery brochures and so on.</u> I enjoy talking to interesting, older people who have some curious life experience and a different work and lifestyle to most of the other people I know. So, it was a stimulating encounter.</p> <p>1 On what occasions do people want to make new friends?</p> <p>2 Where can people make new friends?</p> <p>3 Do you think it is difficult for foreigners to talk with Chinese?</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
