And explain how you feel about it

​	One of the latest developments that has appeared in my city is the addition of the subway system, which has greatly improved transportation and connectivity in the district I live. I first noticed the construction of the subway system around 5 years ago when I walked by the construction site on my way to work. It was interesting to see the progress being made on the system as the days went by. The construction of the subway system took around four years to complete, and it was a massive undertaking that involved a significant amount of resources, including financial investments, manpower, and advanced technological equipment. Now it is opened to the public and become an integral part of the city's transportation infrastructure.

​	Personally, I am thrilled with the addition of the subway system in my city. It has made commuting much easier and more convenient, reducing the time it takes to get from one place to another. Additionally, it has helped to reduce traffic congestion on the roads, making it much easier to navigate through the city during peak hours. Overall, I believe that the addition of the subway system is a great development for the city, and I look forward to seeing how it continues to evolve and improve over time.

1 Is public transportation population in China?

​	Public transportation is very popular in China. Due to the large population and high demand for transportation, the government has invested heavily in developing and expanding public transport infrastructure, including buses, subways, and trains. The use of public transportation is considered to be more affordable and efficient than private transportation, which has led to a significant increase in the number of people using it.

2 What can be improved in public transport services in your country?

​	While public transport services in my country are generally reliable and efficient, there is always room for improvement. One area that could be improved is the frequency of buses and trains, especially during peak hours. Additionally, some public transport services can be quite crowded and uncomfortable, so measures could be taken to improve the comfort and convenience of passengers, such as increasing the number of seats and improving the air conditioning.

3 What leisure facilities can be used by people of all ages?

​	There are many leisure facilities that can be used by people of all ages, such as parks, swimming pools, and community centers. Parks are a great place to relax and enjoy the outdoors, and many of them have playgrounds and sports facilities that cater to people of all ages. Swimming pools are also a popular leisure activity, and many cities have public pools that are accessible to everyone. Community centers are another option, offering a range of activities and classes that cater to people of all ages, from dance classes and language courses to art workshops and fitness programs. Overall, there are many leisure facilities available that offer something for everyone, regardless of age or interests.
