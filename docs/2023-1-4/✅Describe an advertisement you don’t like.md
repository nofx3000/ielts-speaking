And explain why you don’t like this advertisement

​	The advertisement that I found extremely annoying is an online shopping ad. I was first exposed to this ad a few weeks ago while I was using my laptop browsing other web pages.

​	This ad is designed in such a way that it is almost impossible to ignore. It pops up with a loud and irritating sound, which immediately catches your attention. Then, a flashy scrolling bar appears on the screen with the words "Click here to get your free coupon now!" written on it. The scrolling bar flashes and moves constantly, making it difficult to focus on anything else.

​	Whenever I tried to close the ad, it became even more difficult because the close button was either too small or not visible at all. The ad took up most of the screen space, making it impossible to see what I was browsing. The worst part of this advertisement is that the free coupon it promises is actually a scam. To get any discounts, you have to buy items from the website first. 

​	In conclusion, I don't like this advertisement because it interfered with my browsing experience, made false promises, and was impossible to ignore or close. I believe that advertisements should be informative and provide value to consumers, rather than causing frustration and deception.

**1 Do you think it is useful to use celebrities in commercials?**

​	I think using celebrities in commercials can be a useful marketing strategy for companies. Celebrities have a large following, and their endorsement can increase brand awareness and promote products to a wider audience. When a celebrity endorses a product, their fans are more likely to trust and buy it, as they see it as a stamp of approval from someone they admire.

**2 Do you think the adverts online are directed at young people, while those on TV and newspaper are directed at old people?**

​	I am not 100% agree. With the rise of digital media, more and more people of all ages are using the internet to consume information and shop online. As a result, companies are increasingly turning to online platforms to target customers of all age groups.	However, it's true that some products and services may be more relevant to certain age groups, and advertisers may choose to target those groups accordingly.
