**Describe a noisy place you have been to.**

What it is

When you went there

What you did there

And explain why you feel it is a noisy place

​	One of the noisiest places I have ever been to was the Universal Studios theme park in Beijing. I visited this park during my summer vacation with my wife last year.

​	Upon entering the park, we were immediately surrounded by variety of noise, including tourist's laughter and chatter, baby's crying, the screams of people on the roller coasters, the roar of engines from the rides, and the mixture of sound effects from explosions to hilarious music, all these blended together to create a cacophony of noise that was impossible to ignore.

​	We had a blast exploring the different areas of the park and trying out the different rides in a choatic environment. We rode the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, which was a combination of a roller coaster and a simulation that made us feel like we were flying on broomsticks. We also tried out Jurassic World ride, where we encountered giant dinosaurs that roared and snarled as we went through the attraction. I have to admit it was an exciting trip, every ride and attraction were so immersive, we laughed, we screamed, what is funny is that finally we found ourselves had became the people who were making noise. 

​	Overall, despite the overwhelming noise and chaos, I still found the trip in Universal Studios to be an interesting and unforgettable experience. 

**1 Do you think it is good for children to make noise?**

​	I believe that it is perfectly natural for children to make noise, as it is a way for them to express themselves and explore their surroundings. Making noise is an important part of a child's development, as it helps them learn and communicate with others. However, it's also important for children to learn when it's appropriate to make noise and when they need to be quiet.

**2 Should children not be allowed to make noise under any circumstances?**

​	No, I don't think children should be prohibited from making noise altogether. As I mentioned earlier, making noise is a natural part of a child's development, and it can be beneficial for their cognitive and social development. Of course, there are situations where it's important for children to be quiet, such as in a classroom or a library, but overall, I believe that children should be allowed to make noise within reasonable limits.

**3 Which do you think makes louder noise, cities or the countryside?**

​	In general, I think that cities tend to make more noise than the countryside. This is because cities are more densely populated, with more people, traffic, and businesses, which all contribute to the noise level. However, there are certainly areas in the countryside that can be noisy as well, such as near airports or highways.

**4 What types of noise do you come across in daily life?**

​	In my daily life, I come across a variety of noises, such as the sound of traffic outside my window, people talking and laughing, music playing on the radio or in stores, and the hum of appliances in my home. I also hear natural sounds like birds chirping and the wind blowing.

**5 How do people respond to noises in your country?**

​	In my country, people tend to have different responses to noise depending on the situation. In general, people are accepting of noise in public places, such as in restaurants or on public transportation, but they expect others to be respectful of their personal space and not make too much noise. If someone is being excessively loud or disruptive, people may politely ask them to lower their volume or move to a more appropriate location. However, there are also noise ordinances in place in some areas that regulate the amount of noise that is acceptable in residential areas.
