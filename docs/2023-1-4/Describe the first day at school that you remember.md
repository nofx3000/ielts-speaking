What happened on that day

And explain why you still remember the experience

​	I remember my first day at school vividly, even though it was many years ago. It was a sunny September morning, and I was five years old. The school was located in the heart of my hometown, just a few blocks away from my house.

​	As I walked into the classroom, I was greeted by a friendly teacher who introduced herself and showed me around the classroom. I remember feeling a bit nervous and overwhelmed by all the new faces and surroundings, but the teacher's warm smile and reassuring words put me at ease.

​	Throughout the day, we engaged in various activities, such as singing songs, playing games, and learning the alphabet. I made some new friends and enjoyed getting to know my classmates.

​	I still remember this experience because it marked the beginning of my formal education and opened up a whole new world of learning and discovery for me. It was a significant milestone in my life, and I cherish the memories of that day. 

**1 What would parents prepare for their kids when they first go to school?**

​	When children first go to school, parents typically prepare them by buying school supplies, such as backpacks, pencils, notebooks, and other necessary items. They may also help their children get dressed and pack a lunch or snack for the day. Additionally, parents may talk to their children about what to expect at school and how to behave in a classroom setting.

**2 How do children socialise with each other?**

​	Children socialize with each other in a variety of ways, such as playing games, sharing toys, and engaging in group activities. They may also talk and interact with each other during class, recess, and other school-related events. Socializing with peers is an important part of a child's development, as it helps them learn important social skills, such as communication, cooperation, and empathy.

**3 Should children learn how to socialize with others?**

​	Yes, it is important for children to learn how to socialize with others. Social skills are essential for success in both personal and professional settings, and they help children build positive relationships with others. By learning how to communicate effectively, work in groups, and understand others' perspectives, children can develop the skills they need to navigate social situations and build strong, supportive relationships throughout their lives. Schools can play an important role in teaching social skills by providing opportunities for children to interact with each other and by teaching social-emotional learning skills in the classroom.
