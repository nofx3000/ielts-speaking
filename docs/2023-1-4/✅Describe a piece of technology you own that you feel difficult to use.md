**Describe a piece of technology you own that you feel difficult to use.**

- What it is

- When you got it

- How often you use it

- And explain how you feel about it

​	I would like to talk about my MacBook, which is a laptop manufactured by Apple. I got it from my wife about a year ago as a birthday gift. I use it almost daily for a variety of tasks such as writing code, doing research, and browsing the internet.

​	However, I have to admit that I initially found it quite difficult to use because I was used to using Windows computers before. The operating system on the MacBook, called macOS, is quite different from Windows. For example, the file system is organized differently, and some keyboard shortcuts are not the same as well. So it took me some time to adapt to it.

​	At first, I felt frustrated and even a bit intimidated by the MacBook, but after few days I gradually started to appreciate its features and design. I found that the interface is more intuitive and user-friendly once you get used to it. Also, the build quality of the MacBook is exceptional, and it feels very solid and well-made compared to other laptops I've used before.

​	<u>Nowadays, I feel much more comfortable using my MacBook, and I even prefer it over Windows computers in some ways. For instance, I like the integration with other Apple devices such as my iPhone, and the ecosystem of apps and services is very convenient.</u> Overall, I think the MacBook is a great piece of technology, although it does take some time and effort to learn how to use it properly, especially if you're used to using Windows.
