​	When I was young, one of the activities I enjoyed most in my free time was being part of a band with my university classmates. This band was formed during our first year at university, and it quickly became a significant part of our lives.

​	It was a cover band and I was the vocalist, I did this activity with a close-knit group of friends who were also my classmates, we all shared a love for music and enjoyed spending time together. We covered many popular songs from various genres. We usually practiced and performed in the music room in our university, and we even held a live concert on a lawn in campus. Our shared passion for music brought us closer together, and we formed strong bonds that have lasted well beyond our university years.

​	   The reason why I enjoyed this activity so much is because it allowed me to express myself creatively and explore my musical talents. Playing in a band also taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration, as we had to work together to create harmonious and engaging performances. Additionally, it was a fantastic way to unwind and relax after a long day of classes and studying. The camaraderie and shared experiences with my bandmates made this activity truly special, and it remains one of my fondest memories from my youth.

**1 Is it important to take a break during work or study?**

​	Yes, it is crucial to take breaks during work or study. Research has shown that taking regular breaks can improve productivity, creativity, and overall well-being. When we work or study for extended periods without taking breaks, our brains become fatigued, and our ability to concentrate and retain information decreases. Taking breaks allows us to recharge our batteries, clear our minds, and return to our work or study with renewed focus and energy.

**2 Are there more activities for young people to do now than 20 years ago?**

​	Yes, there are undoubtedly more activities for young people to do now than 20 years ago. With the advent of technology and the internet, young people have access to a vast array of activities and entertainment options that were not available in the past. For example, social media platforms, online gaming, and streaming services have all become popular pastimes for young people. Additionally, there are more opportunities for young people to participate in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities than ever before.

**3 What types of exercise do people in your country often do?**

​	In my country, people often engage in a variety of exercises, including running, cycling, swimming, and yoga. Running and cycling are particularly popular, as they are relatively easy to do and require minimal equipment. Swimming is also a popular choice, especially during the summer months when people can take advantage of outdoor pools and beaches. Yoga has also gained popularity in recent years, as it offers a low-impact form of exercise that can improve flexibility, strength, and mental well-being.

**4 Do adults and children have enough time for leisure activities nowadays?**

​	It depends on the individual's circumstances, but in general, many adults and children do not have enough time for leisure activities nowadays. With the increasing demands of work, school, and other responsibilities, it can be challenging to find time for leisure activities. Additionally, the rise of technology and social media has made it easier to become distracted and spend more time on screens, which can further reduce the time available for leisure activities. However, it is essential to prioritize leisure time and make an effort to carve out time for activities that bring joy and relaxation.
