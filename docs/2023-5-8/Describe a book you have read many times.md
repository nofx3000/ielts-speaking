​	"Animal Farm" by George Orwell is a book that has left a profound impact on me and one that I have read numerous times. This allegorical novel portrays a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, aiming to create an egalitarian society where all animals are equal. However, their utopian ideals gradually crumble as power corrupts and a new form of tyranny takes hold.

​	I find myself returning to "Animal Farm" at random intervals, drawn by its thought-provoking themes and Orwell's masterful storytelling. The book serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of authoritarianism, propaganda, and the abuse of power. Each time I read it, I uncover new layers of meaning and gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of political systems.<u>The book's ability to shed light on the human condition and expose the flaws of societal structures fascinates me.</u>

​	This book has heightened my awareness of political manipulation and the importance of remaining vigilant in safeguarding democratic principles. It has also deepened my understanding of the potential consequences when power is concentrated in the hands of a few. Through its vivid portrayal of the animals' struggle for freedom, "Animal Farm" has instilled in me a sense of responsibility to question authority and to defend equality and justice.
