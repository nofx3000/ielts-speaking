​	During my childhood, one game that left an indelible mark on my memories is "StarCraft," a real-time strategy game. I firstly played "StarCraft" at my friend's house and was immediately drawn into its science-fiction background and fascinating artwork. Then I begged my father to got a copy of it for me as well.

​	Most of the time, I played "StarCraft" alone, exploring the captivating single-player campaign, where I took on the role of three different factions, each with its unique abilities and objectives. However, occasionally, I played multiplayer matches with my friends. Those sessions were particularly exhilarating as we strategized and battled against each other.

It instilled me a sense of confidence and taught me valuable skills such as critical thinking, adaptability, and teamwork. The period I sat in front of my PC playing "StarCraft" still remains a teasured memory to this day.
