And how you felt about it

​	The child I spent time with is my best friend's new born son named Sunny. I heard this news about half a year ago when my friend sent me a text message announcing the birth of his son.  I was very happy for him and his wife when I received his message, and I went to their house to visit few days ago.

​	Upon arriving at their home, I was greeted with the most adorable sight - baby Sunny was peacefully asleep in his cradle. His tiny fingers and delicate features made my heart melt with joy.  Luckly I had the privilege of holding Sunny in my arms. He was so small and fragile, and I couldn't help but marvel at the miracle of life. We spent the afternoon together, taking turns playing with him and ensuring he was comfortable and happy.

​	It filled me with joy and excitement, I felt a strong sense of happiness and a deep sense of pride for my friend, for starting a new chapter in his life as a father. At the same time, I can felt the heavy burden over his shoulder for carrying a new life as well !

**1 Do you think children should have a lot of toys?**

​	n my opinion, children should have a reasonable number of toys. Toys play a vital role in a child's development, fostering creativity, imagination, and cognitive skills. However, having too many toys can lead to materialism and a lack of appreciation for the things they have. It's essential for parents to strike a balance and provide a diverse range of toys that encourage learning and exploration. 

**2 Do you think there are too many rules for children to follow?**

​	While rules are necessary to provide structure and discipline, there is possibly too many rules for children. Children should also be given the opportunity to understand the reasons behind certain rules, fostering a sense of responsibility and moral reasoning.

**3 Do you think it’s good for parents to help their children choose friends?**

​	Parents can certainly play a crucial role in guiding their children's social interactions. It is essential to help children understand the qualities of a good friend. However, parents should also encourage their children to develop their own friendships naturally. A healthy balance is necessary.

**4 How can parents help children make decisions?**

​	Parents can support children in decision-making by fostering open communication. Listening to their child's thoughts and concerns allows parents to better understand their perspective and offer appropriate guidance. Parents can also help by presenting choices and discussing potential consequences, enabling children to learn from their decisions. 

**5 At what age should children start to make decisions?**

​	he age at which children start making decisions can vary depending on their maturity and individual development.  From a young age, children can begin making simple choices. As they grow older and become more capable of understanding consequences, parents can gradually involve them in more significant decisions,.
