A long car journey that holds a special place in my memory is the trip I took to visit my mother-in-law. It's a beautiful coastal city locate in the eastern China,  about 600 kilometer away from my home. I went there with my wife. We took bags of snacks for basic provisions to eat and shared a drive along the way .

When we got there, we found that place a truly a paradise with pristine sandy beaches, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and a serene ambiance that is simply breathtaking. This coastal city is renowned for its natural beauty and offers a host of recreational activities. We experienced a lot of water sport such as surfing, fishing, and boating which brought us tons of fun. We also visited the local shops, resturants and cafe.

The primary reason we chose to travel by car was it provided us flexibility and convenience. It enabled us to explore different locations at our own pace and witness the scenic landscapes along the way. Moreover, traveling by car enabled us to carry essential items, making the trip comfortable and enjoyable for everyone.
