​	Recently, my wife and I had watched the highly acclaimed film "Birdman" on the Internet. We watched it is because it is an Oscar award-winning film with tons of positive comment and an appealing review. 

​	The story revolves around a former superhero actor,  who tries to revive his career by staging a Broadway play as he battles with his inner demons, navigates complicated relationships, and tries to prove his worth in the world of show business.

​	We were eager to experience its unique storytelling and remarkable performances. However, much to our disappointment, the film failed to live up to our high expectations. While the technical aspects, such as the continuous long takes, were impressive, the story felt convoluted and overly pretentious. The characters lacked depth and relatability, making it difficult for me to invest emotionally in their journeys. Additionally, the constant use of surreal elements and ambiguous narrative made it hard to follow the plot.

​	Overall, "Birdman" left me disheartened due to its failure to explore the complexities of fame, identity, and artistic pursuits. Despite its accolades, the film fell short in delivering a satisfying and cohesive cinematic experience, leaving me disappointed.
