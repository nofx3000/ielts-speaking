Why there were many people

And explain how you felt when staying with those people

​	One place with a lot of people I have ever been to was the Universal Studios theme park in Beijing. I visited this park during my summer vacation with my wife last year.

​	The main reason there were so many people is because It was a famous theme park with a vast array of unique and immersive amusement equipment that attract people from everywhere, such as Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, Jurassic World ride and Transformer roller coaster etc. Additionally, It was at summer vacation, many students with their friends or parents flocked to there to have some fun.

​	Upon entering the park, we were immediately surrounded by variety of noise, including tourist's laughter and chatter, baby's crying, the screams of people on the roller coasters. I did felt a little bit frustrated at the beginning, especially for waiting so long at the queue in a burning summer day. However, despite the overwhelming number of visitors, I have to admit, shared happiness with such lot of people was an interesting and unforgettable experience to me.
