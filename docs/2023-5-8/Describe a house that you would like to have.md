**Describe a house that you would like to have.**

You should say:

What it is like

Where it would be

Why you would like to have such place

And explain how you feel about the place

​	The house I envision is a charming tree house, evoking a sense of adventure and connection to nature. It would be a small yet cozy structure built amidst the branches of a majestic tree, surrounded by lush greenery. The design would prioritize simplicity, with wooden walls, large windows, and a spacious balcony offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.

​	Ideally, my dream tree house would be located in the deepth of a tranquil forest,  far away from the chaos of urban life. It would be the best if there were a river nearby, which would provide me the source of life and a sense of calm and tranquility.

​	I would love to have such a place because it offers a wild living experience. The idea of living in a tree house ignites my sense of adventure and allows me to reconnect with the simplicity of childhood. It would be a place where I could disconnect from the digital world and immerse myself in the beauty of the nature.

​	Imagining myself in this tree house fills me with a sense of wonder and excitement. I feel a deep connection to nature and appreciate the peacefulness it brings. The idea of waking up to the gentle sway of the branches and being surrounded by the sights and sounds of the forest instills a sense of harmony and contentment within me.

**1 What’s the difference between an apartment and a house?**

​	The main difference between an apartment and a house lies in ownership and living arrangements. An apartment is typically a part of a larger building and is rented or owned by an individual or family. It usually has shared facilities and limited outdoor space. On the other hand, a house is a standalone structure, often with its own land, offering more privacy and freedom to customize the property to one's liking.
