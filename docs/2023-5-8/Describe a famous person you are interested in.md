​	I would like to talk about the legendary actor, Clint Eastwood.  I first saw him in the movie  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and was immediately drawn to his incredible talent and charisma. 

​	Before rising to stardom, Eastwood led a rather unassuming life. He started his acting career with minor roles and struggled to make ends meet. However, his determination and perseverance eventually paid off when he was cast in the movie "The Unforgiven".  Eastwood played the character of William Munny, a retired outlaw who is forced to pick up his guns one last time to help a young prostitute seek revenge against the men who disfigured her.

​	Eastwood's portrayal of Munny brought a depth and complexity to the character that was truly mesmerizing to watch. From his quiet determination to his intense emotional scenes, Eastwood's performance was nothing short of brilliant. And this is the mainly reason why I admire this actor, his ability to fully embody and bring to life his characters is simply awe-inspiring.

​	Besides, his contributions to the film industry as a whole also cannot be overstated. Not only has he starred in countless iconic movies, but he has also directed and produced many award-winning films. His versatility and dedication make him a true icon and effect me deeply.

**1 Are there any other kinds of famous people in your country?**

​	Yes, apart from actors and musicians, there are various other kinds of famous people in my country. This includes renowned sports personalities, accomplished authors and poets, influential politicians, celebrated scientists and inventors, prominent business tycoons, and even social activists who have made significant contributions to society.

**2 Do you think celebrities should necessarily be good at their field?**

​	While it is ideal for celebrities to excel in their respective fields, it is not always a prerequisite. Some celebrities gain fame through reality TV shows or social media platforms without possessing exceptional talent. However, in my opinion, genuine admiration and long-term success are more likely for those who demonstrate expertise and mastery in their chosen field.

**3 What are the differences between famous people today and those in the past?**

​	One notable difference between famous people today and those in the past is the rapidity and ease with which individuals can attain fame. In the past, becoming famous required extensive hard work, recognition from industry gatekeepers, and limited media exposure. However, with the advent of social media and reality TV, fame has become more accessible, and individuals can gain recognition quickly, sometimes without substantial accomplishments.

**4 Do you think media is putting too much attention on famous people?**

​	Yes, it can be argued that media is putting an excessive amount of attention on famous people. In today's celebrity-obsessed culture, media outlets often prioritize sensationalized stories and personal lives of celebrities over important news and societal issues. The constant scrutiny and invasion of privacy can have detrimental effects on famous individuals as well. However, it is important for the media to strike a balance and prioritize responsible journalism that informs and educates the public on a wider range of topics.
