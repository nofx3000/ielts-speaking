​	One experience that I lost my way was the first time I visited Universal Studios theme park in Beijing with my wife.

​	It was a day in summer vacation, tons of people flocked there to have some fun. Upon entering the park, we were immediately drawn into the sea of people and surrounded by variety of noise. We were supposed to visit the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, which is located in the northeast section of the park, but we couldn't because we were swept along with the crowd, and before we knew it,  we had totally lost sense of direction. Adding to the gloomy, the sky started to rain, we decided to seek assistance from a staff member. The staff kindly provided us a map, however the map was confusing and we got even more lost, especially as the map started to get soaking wet with all the rain. Fortunately, with the guide of GPS map and the help from a kind old man, we eventually managed to navigate through the chaos, and found we were just few blocks away from the destination.

​	The initial feeling of getting lost was frustration and confusion, especially in such a bad weather. However, it was interesting and exciting when we took this experience as an adventure.
