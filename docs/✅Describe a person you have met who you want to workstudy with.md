​	A person I would like to work with in the future is my friend, Andy. Andy is a programmer for as long as I can remember. He’s from my home town, but also, he went to the same university as me, in fact, in the same year. From my perspective , Andy has always been keen on starting his own business – he has a very strong entrepreneurial streak, and most certainly a good way of thinking about business and future trends. He seems always on the ball, always aware of key market trends across different industries and has a strong interest in innovation. So, as well as being a programmer, he’s actually a person who I am sure would make a fantastic business person, especially in the developing field of IT. As for me, I would love to start a small company too, because I’ve always wanted to work for myself, rather than be just a cog in the machine of a big established company. So Andy seems like an ideal person to start a new business with, because we’ve known each other for at least 10 years we are also very familiar with how best to communicate with each other, resolve conflicts that might arise and basically work hard to make a project or enterprise a real success. I’d love to work with Andy.

3 What kinds of people are popular at work?

​	In my opinion, people who are popular at work are those who possess a range of skills and qualities that enable them to excel in their role and collaborate effectively with others. One key trait that makes someone popular is their ability to communicate clearly and listen actively. These individuals are able to articulate their ideas and opinions effectively, while also demonstrating an openness to feedback and ideas from others.
