And explain why you often visit it

​	A website i'd like to share is a popular video sharing platform in China called BiliBili. This website primarily focuses on animation, comics, and games, but it also has an extensive collection of educational content. I first discovered this website while searching for video tutorials on web development and programming. 

​	I visit BiliBili quite frequently, almost daily. The reason why I often visit it is that it provides a vast array of resources and video tutorials that are not available on other platforms. As a person who is passionate about learning new web development techniques, I find BiliBili to be an invaluable resource for improving my skills and keeping up with the latest trends in the industry.

​	In addition to its educational content, BiliBili also has a vibrant community of developers and designers who share their knowledge and experience through blog posts, forum discussions, and Q&A sessions. I find it very inspiring to engage with like-minded individuals and learn from their experiences.

​	Overall, BiliBili has become an essential part of my learning journey, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in programming, web development, or any other related field. 



**1 What are the most popular and the least popular apps in China?**

​	In China, i believe the most popular app is WeChat. WeChat is a multi-purpose social media app that offers messaging, video calling, e-commerce, and many other features, and it has become an essential part of everyday life for many Chinese people. As for the least popular apps, I really don't have a clue, because there are too many, i mean, the apps that apart from the most popular apps all counts, right?

**2 Why do some people prefer to read news online instead of watching news on TV?**

​	There are several reasons. Firstly, online news is more accessible and convenient, as it can be accessed from anywhere at any time, using a smartphone or computer. Secondly, online news is more diverse and customizable, as readers can choose from a variety of sources and topics that interest them. Thirdly, online news is often more up-to-date and faster to report breaking news, compared to traditional TV news broadcasts.

**3 What kinds of people would still go to library to read and study?**

​	People who still go to the library to read and study are often those who prefer a quiet and focused environment for learning and research. They may be students who need access to specialized resources or books, or professionals who need a space to work on projects or research. Additionally, some people may enjoy the atmosphere of a library, with its peaceful surroundings and the ability to concentrate on their work without distractions.
