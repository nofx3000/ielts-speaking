​	I know a lot of fashionable people, but the one really stick in my mind is an old lady i met on a wedding.  It was a very tastefully wedding, in a lovely hotel, with a very beautiful garden. I met her at the wedding party. What caught my eye the most was her stunning outfit. She was dressed in a beautiful floral dress with a matching jacket that had intricate lace detailing. Her hair was perfectly coiffed, and she wore a statement necklace that added an extra touch of glamour to her outfit. I was amazed by how effortlessly she carried herself, and I couldn't help but think that she was the epitome of class and sophistication. We talked a lot , she told me she was an interior designer for hotels and galleries all over Asia and turned out she was in her early 70s! I just couldn't believe it. We also chatted about art, design, music and thoughts about life and all sorts of stuff. She invited me to the opening of one of her art galleries in Beijing, for the following week, and we ended up getting to know each other, and we still stay in touch today. Overall, encountering this fashionable old lady was a memorable experience that left a lasting impression on me. She showed me that age is just a number, and that one can be fashionable and stylish at any stage of life. Her positive attitude and zest for life were truly inspiring, and I feel fortunate to have met her.

**1 Are older people as fashionable as young people?**

​	In my opinion, age should not be a determining factor in whether or not someone can be fashionable. While it is true that young people tend to be more experimental with fashion and may have more access to trendy clothing and accessories, I have seen many older people who have a keen sense of style and can pull off fashion-forward looks with ease.

​	I believe that fashion is a form of self-expression, and it is up to individuals to decide how they want to present themselves to the world, regardless of their age. In fact, I think that older people often have an advantage when it comes to fashion because they have a better understanding of what suits their body type and personal style. They have had more time to experiment with different looks and know what works for them.

​	In conclusion, I believe that older people can be just as fashionable as young people, and that age should not be a barrier to expressing oneself through fashion. With the right attitude and a good understanding of one's personal style, anyone can be fashionable and stylish, regardless of their age.

**2 Are women more fashionable than men?**

​	I believe that fashion is not necessarily about gender, but rather an individual's personal style and how they choose to express themselves through clothing and accessories. While there may be societal expectations or stereotypes that suggest women are more fashionable than men, I think it's important to recognize that fashion is a form of self-expression that is unique to each individual.

**3 Why is fashion more important to some people?**

Fashion is a form of self-expression and can serve many purposes for different people. For some, fashion may be important because it helps them to feel confident and express their individuality. By choosing certain clothing styles or accessories, they can communicate something about their personality, interests, or values to the world.

Fashion can also be important for some people as a means of fitting in or belonging to a certain group or subculture. For example, certain fashion styles may be associated with specific musical genres, sports teams, or social movements, and wearing these styles can help people to feel like they are part of a larger community.

Furthermore, fashion can be a source of inspiration and creativity for some people. 

In conclusion, fashion can be important to different people for a variety of reasons, it is up to each individual to decide how important fashion is to them and how they want to express themselves through clothing and accessories.
