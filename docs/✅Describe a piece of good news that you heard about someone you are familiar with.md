When you heard it

How you knew it

And explain how you felt about it

​	One piece of good news that I recently heard about is that my childhood best friend<u>, whom I have known since we were three years old,</u> just had a new baby boy. I heard this news about one month ago when he sent me a text message announcing the birth of his son.

​	 I was very happy for him and his wife when I received his message, I knew that they had been expecting, as he had shared the news that his wife was pregnant a few months ago. However, I did not know the exact due date, so I was pleasantly surprised about the birth of his son. It filled me with joy and excitement, I felt a strong sense of happiness and a deep sense of pride for my friend, for starting a new chapter in his life as a father. At the same time, I can  felt the heavy burden over his shoulder for carrying a new life as well !

​	From what my friend has told me, his son is adorable and healthy, and he and his wife are overjoyed to be parents. I can't wait to meet them with bundle of joy and watch the baby grow up alongside our lifelong friendship.

**1 Is it good to share something on social media?**

​	In today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for people to share their opinions, experiences, and emotions with a wider audience. While there are certainly some negative aspects to social media, such as the spread of misinformation or cyberbullying, I believe that overall, sharing something on social media can be a positive thing. By sharing our thoughts and experiences, we can connect with others who may be going through similar situations, and we can also raise awareness about important issues that might not get as much attention otherwise. Additionally, social media can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, especially those who live far away.

**2 Should the media only publish good news?**

​	While it's certainly important for the media to report on important news events, but not only the good news. They should strive to present a fair and unbiased view of events, while also highlighting positive developments and stories of hope.
