​	One of the historical periods that has always fascinated me is the Renaissance era, which spanned from the 14th to the 17th century in Europe. I have learned about this period of history through various sources such as books, documentaries, and academic courses, which have sparked my curiosity and inspired me to delve deeper into this era.

​	What interests me the most about the Renaissance period is the significant cultural, scientific, and artistic advancements that occurred during this time. It was a period of great intellectual growth and a time when some of the most remarkable works of art and literature were produced. I am particularly interested in the Renaissance's impact on the world of science, as it was a time when scientific inquiry flourished, and new discoveries were made in fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and physics. Additionally, the Renaissance was a period of significant social and political changes, marked by the rise of humanism and the emergence of new ideas about government and individual rights. 

​	I want to know more about the Renaissance period because I believe that it was a pivotal moment in human history that has shaped our modern world in many ways. Understanding the Renaissance era will not only enrich my knowledge but also help me appreciate the legacy of the past and its impact on our present and future.

**1 How do children learn about history?**

​	Children usually learn about history in school, to be honest, or from programs on television. We mainly learn about the history of our own country, for the most part, but we sometimes have classes about world history too. Children should at least develop a basic understanding of the history of their nation, and its relationships with others throughout time, and also we can learn from the past, so history is quite important.

**2 Do you think everyone should know about history of their own country?**

​	Yes, I think to some extent that is important yes. It depends on the objectives really. I mean, if it is to promote a greater understanding of life and help young people to contribute to making their country better in the future, then I think that’s a very good reason, and we can also learn from the mistakes and failures as well as the victories that our country has experienced in the past.

**3 Do you think it is hard to protect historical buildings?**

​	It isn’t that hard really, if there is money and funding resources directed to doing so. But that depends on the decisions of the local governments, I think, and also how important those buildings are and how expensive they might be to upkeep. I think that it’s also a case of educating people about the importance of their own heritage. Protecting old buildings can also bring tourism to a place and inspire interest in places which maybe people have forgotten about. This, in turn, helps the economy of an area develop as well.
