Why the air was polluted

And explain how you felt about the place

​	The place I visited where the air was heavily polluted is Beijing. I visited there every day, because I live there. Beijing is a city that has been facing severe air pollution for many years. The reason behind the polluted air in Beijing is largely due to the city's high levels of industrialization and heavy traffic. The city has numerous factories and power plants, which produce large amounts of pollutants. Additionally, the high volume of cars on the road and the prevalence of coal as a source of heating in winter also contribute to the air pollution problem.

​	During the worst period of pollution, the air was too thick to breath with smog, and visibility was too low to drive or even to walk.  The air quality index (AQI) was off the charts, and the government had issued an alert asking people to stay indoors as much as possible. Despite the warning, many people still had to go out for living, wearing masks to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the polluted air.

​	Being through such heavy pollution made me appreciate the value of clean air.  However, I also felt a sense of hope, as the Chinese government is taking steps to address the issue. They are investing in clean energy and are encouraging people to use public transport <u>to reduce the number of cars on the roads</u>. I believe that with these efforts, Beijing will be able to improve its air quality and provide a healthier environment for its residents.

**1 In what ways can air quality be improved effectively?**

​	Air quality can be improved in several ways, both through individual and collective efforts. One of the most effective ways is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and encourage the transition towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. This can be done by incentivizing the adoption of cleaner technologies and investing in research and development to make them more affordable and accessible.

**2 Do you think cities are cleaner that the countryside?**

​	This is a difficult question to answer definitively, as it largely depends on the specific cities and countryside areas being compared. However, in general, cities tend to have higher levels of air pollution due to the higher concentration of vehicles and industrial activities. On the other hand, rural areas may have pollution issues related to agricultural practices, such as the use of pesticides and fertilizers.

​	That being said, it's important to note that there are many factors that can influence air quality in both cities and rural areas, and it's not always a clear-cut comparison.

**3 Do you think many factories have been forced to reduce emission?**

​	Yes, I believe that many factories have been forced to reduce emissions due to increasing public awareness and government regulations. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on environmental protection and sustainability, and many countries have introduced laws and incentives to encourage companies to reduce their carbon footprint. This has led to an increase in the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices, such as the use of renewable energy and more efficient production processes. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving truly sustainable and environmentally-friendly industrial practices.
